# ChainTix
## Decentralized ticket sale and resale platform
Chaintix uses the polygon network to create NFTs for tickets. This allows management and approval of transactions to be handled by the netowrk, allowing for cheap and easily verifyiable networks. 

I carryied over project setup from previous project so some files may be unnessary at checkpoint, but will be properly managed by final submit.
