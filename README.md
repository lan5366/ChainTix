# ChainTix
## Decentralized ticket sale and resale platform
Chaintix uses the polygon network to create NFTs for tickets. This allows management and approval of transactions to be handled by the netowrk, allowing for cheap and easily verifyiable networks. 

I carryied over project setup from previous project so some files may be unnessary at checkpoint, but will be properly managed by final submit.

The create event page is basic for now. Specific seating is going to be tricky to get running well, but should be doable. My idea as of now is to create a system that allows organizers to create an excel file formatted in a specific manner that allows me to run a program that can take that in and use to easily label sold tickets. 

The events page will also support images in final version.
